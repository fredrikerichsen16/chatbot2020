Use Vue.js for the frontend chat window.

Use Python for backend.
- NLTK for natural language processing
- TensorFlow for machine learning intent classification

## JavaScript!?
Should I perhaps use Node.js for the backend instead of Python?

Advantages:
- Both front-end and backend are JavaScript.
- Don't have to convert JSON back and forth.
- Feel like working with complicated JSON-like objects (dictionaries in Python) is easier with Node.js. I'm using MongoDB heavily to store data, easier to work with Node.js.
- Fast
- Many lightweight frameworks to chose from.
- Easy to find people to hire and work with - everyone knows JavaScript. Also, potential hires only need to know JavaScript well and can work on both front-end and back-end.

Disadvantages:
- Python object-oriented features are better than JavaScript's. Python classes are a breeze to work with. Inheritance and such sucks with Node.js. However, I could use TypeScript. TypeScript makes it easier to work with classes and inheritance and looks nice to code in.
- Python's NLTK is probably better than Node.js Natural at NLP in languages other than English.

Neutrals/Unknowns:
- Libraries:
    - Python: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and TensorFlow
    - Node.js equivalent: [natural](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural) (seems good enough for the few features I need) and TensorFlow.js/Propel (seems fine, but Python is probably better for Machine Learning. I can use Python only for the machine learning part if necessary. But again, JS is probably fine.)
- Maybe I can use BOTH Node.js and Python. Node.js for almost everything - Python only for NLTK and Machine Learning. Google "How to use Node.js and Python together".
