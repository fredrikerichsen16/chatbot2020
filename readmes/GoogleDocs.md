## Design
- open chat button in bottom right like intercom but with mascot sticking out and some text

## Company types
Company types that could use these services:
- Bank
- Services
- Insurance (like file an insurance claim)
- car rental
- Restaurants
- Hotels
- Colleges
- e-commerce sites (digital assistant, ask for a tv within a price range, size etc. bot redirects you to a filtered page)
- stores (clothing, car, electronics)
- Custom built chatbots requested by for example
- Premier League/NBA etc. apps (Ask for game times, scores etc.)


## Other
- Make app for all businesses

- select business type and subtype; custom code template based on type. Restaurant->fastfood, Activity->Water sport

- Have array of responses. Have one to three slightly differently worded responses

- Get question type, load file with functions for getting responses to that question type

- pyramid of psychedelics, another weed brownie at top (meme idea, lol, put it here for some reason)

- A food menu. List of categories (gradient + text + maybe cartoon) click one and show slideshow + grassroot

- give intents a probability score on top of the score outputted by the neural net. Factors: whether the intent is active or not (for example, the intent casino.hours is not active for a hotel that doesn't have a casino), how common the intent is, how common the intent is marked as "appropriate answer", the domain of the previous few messages

- If user goes back to a previous message answering a prompt from a bot, for example a slider expressing their budget for a hotel room, and changes the answer, they go back to that message and the whole conversation after that point is deleted (warn user of this)
