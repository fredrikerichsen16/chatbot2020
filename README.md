This readme contains an overview of all the features that have to be built. Think of the headers as one separate set and the bullet points as subsets. There are links to more information on how to build each feature.

### Setting up an agent
I.e. the process of creating an agent for the customer, filling in info about their company, preferences for the agent, etc.

- Form for answering questions about the company (opening hours, preferences, menu, prices, offering etc.) and storing that information in a standard JSON format
