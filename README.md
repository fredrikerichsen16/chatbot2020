# November 2021 Update
- I think this chatbot startup is worth attempting. Because of the following reasons:
	- I saw the success of the Stavanger company I forget the name of (which didn't hire me)
	- It's pretty cool and fun technology to work on
	- It's a hype technology for VC purposes whether or not it's good
	- It's also applicable to robots using speech recognition and things like that. Smart robots, smart elevators, smart cars, smart assistants (to help in hospitals or old people homes), Alexa bots etc.
	- After learning about RDF and OWL in Knowledge and Data and going deep on it in my project, I think that's the right kind of technology to use.
	- My attempt on this a few years ago was pretty bad, but with better skills + RDF now I think it can go better.
- How to do it? Don't dedicate that much time to it yet. Try to create a simple bot for one customer type and start to sell it. If we get 10 customers I can hire 2 people or something. I am mainly working on my other startup but this could be a secondary.. Elon Musk style.
- Which customer type is best for the beta testing?
	- Hairdresser 
		- is really easy to make and there are many potential customers with bad websites that could easily jump right from bad website to chatbot instead of bad website to good website.
		- however, it's not that useful to have a chatbot for hairdressers. Booking an appointment is really easy anyways.
	- Hotels
		- Medium easy and medium useful
		- However, hard to sell to hotels and almost nobody goes to the website of a hotel, they go to booking.com etc.
	- Universities
		- Medium to high difficulty to create (huge amount of information, but fairly static unless the chatbot will also be used for current students to ask things like "Am I registered for the exam for knowledge and data?") and medium to high usefulness (so much information that it's hard to navigate the website). Also not that hard to sell. There are very many universities, Dutch universities tend to want to be futuristic etc., they might be sympathetic to student entrepreneurs, and their problems are solved pretty well and pretty easily.
		- However, there aren't any big cons other than it being fairly high difficulty to create and medium difficult to sell.
	- Bank, E-commerce, Insurance, Car rental
		- Profitable
		- However, high difficulty to create and sell
	- Custom solutions - i.e. find a customer first, then deliver a custom solution
		- Guaranteed customer, can build a brand and team etc.
		- Not generally applicable

### Setting up an agent
I.e. the process of creating an agent for the customer, filling in info about their company, preferences for the agent, etc.

- Form for answering questions about the company (opening hours, preferences, menu, prices, offering etc.) and storing that information in a standard JSON format
